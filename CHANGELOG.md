## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added local documentation link checking via `pnpm run check:docs`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- Removed repository GitHub Actions and Dependabot so the upstream project does not depend on GitHub automation.
- Kept lightweight GitHub issue forms and a pull request template for contributor intake; they do not run CI/CD.
- Clarified that the Cloudflare Deploy Button is the Cloudflare-hosted template import path, while `pnpm run install:cloudflare` is the local Agent/CLI deployment path.
- Updated Worker compatibility dates and documented the Node 22 + pnpm local development baseline.

### Verification

- Local release checks and Wrangler dry-run deployment remain the release gate.
